# ap3-jutge (Algorithmics and Programming III)
<p align="justify">This repository contains codes and helpful tools for AP3 (Algorithmic and Programming III) course.</p>

## Compilation settings

<p align="justify">As we are going to use C++ as the main programming language in this course, i have installed g++ compiler in my ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux) distribution. The following line is a remainder about the flags we have to use in order to compile the code file using the cited compiler, show all generated warnings during compilation, choose the level of optimization we require and choose the name of the output file that we will execute to run the final program.</p>

```
g++ -Wall -O3 -std=c++17 code_file_name -o executable_file_name
```

## Useful terminal notation

<p align="justify">Then, wheter we want to feed our executable program with an input file, we can run the following command in the temrinal, providing a test input file.</p>

`./executable_file_name < test_input_file`

<p align="justify">In some cases we might be interested in counting the number of output instances for a given program, we can manage using the following command, that employs a terminal pipeline.</p>

`./executable_file_name < test_input_file | wc`

<p align="justify">We can also use the following command that shows to the user the local execution time of the program, to have an idea, https://jutge.org/ will process your program since 1s execution at you local environment.</p>

`time ./executable_file_name < test_input_file`

<p align="justify">Just to remember known C++ code notation, the following code exemplifies the C++ property to identify automatically a variable type to ease the process of code writting in a complex context. The following code fragment corresponds to a kind of code structure known as RANGE FOR.</p>

```
D = vector<vector<double>>(n, vector<double>(n));
for (auto& R : D) for (auto& d : R) cin >> d;
```

<p align="justify">Here, auto allows the compiler to identify the variable type, in this case, the first variable type is vector<double>, and the second variable type is double.</double>.</p>
